# Random-Labyrinths
During the second year in computer science at the University of Strasbourg, I had to develop a labyrinth in C with many options. 

## Simple description
The user choose a size of the labyrinth that can be a rectangle and some algorithms are going to choose a two opposite doors that must be connected. All the existind ways are random generated. 

## Installation
Use the Makefile to compile : make <br>
Launch with ./main <br>
